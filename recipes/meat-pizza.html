        <img class="image" src="../images/meat pizza.jpg" alt="meat pizza" width="600">
        <p>The first time I heard of this was when back in middle school I was invited to a classmate house to play, his mother made for<br>
            lunch this dish as a second course. Soon after trying it I had to ask for the recipe and was quite surprised something this good <br>
            was quite easy to make, here is the recipe!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>800 g of ground beef meat</li>
                <li>1 l of tomato sauce (if you don` like the one premade sold in the supermarket, you can make the sauce yourself too!)</li>
                <li>400g of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Before starting the actual preparation I strongly suggest you to start pre heating the oven at 200° C if static or 180° C if ventilated. This because as you will see, the next steps are quite fast so it won`t take you long to be done and you will want the oven to be ready as soon as possible </li>
                <li>Start by putting the beef meat in a bowl and add seasoning, you can use whatever seasoning you prefere, I personally use salt, black pepper, a bit of lemon juice and rosemary</li>
                <li>When you are done mixing the meat with the spices, prepare a baking tray (if you don`t have one you can use your oven tray, but I strongly suggest you a baking tray for the next step) and add some of the tomato sauce to the bottom and try to even it out, this way while cooking the bottom won`t get dry or burn and stick to the tray</li>
                <li>After this little step, put in the meat and try to distribute it evenly in the tray, when done pour over the meat the remaining tomato sauce and put the baking tray in the oven</li>
                <li>Let the meat cook around 25 minutes, after that take it out to add on the top the mozzarella cheese, when you are done put back the tray in the oven and let it cook for another 15 minutes</li>
                <li>When it`s done cooking , you can either let it rest before serving it or serve it immediately</li>
                <li><h4>Enjoy!</h4></li>

            </ol>
